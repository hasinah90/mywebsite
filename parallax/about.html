  <p id="p2"> At the beginning, it was hard to come up with an idea that meets tha goal of this long scrolling website. I started to think about new ideas and had two different ideas in mind. But unfortanetly didn't success because of the lack of images and quality. So I proceed with a second thought of creating and designing this long website about some happy memories of my children life from birth till now in different ages. I started to draw sketches and think how the website is going to look like. So it is basically contains of 18 hidden bubbles that have different pictures of my children.
  The other main object is that a bunny that flys upside down, so when is on a specific location or edge, a bubble appears with a picture. I thought that including a bunny will give the page a more childish look.</p>
